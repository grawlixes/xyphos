Currently, Xyphos can shave the Macbeth document from 116 KB to 99 KB.

# What to do
  -Add a decompression module
  -Maybe include more words in the compression list?
  
# More info for the interested
  -As you can probably tell, the efficiency of Xyphos tends to increase as the text files it compresses get larger.
  -For Macbeth, the file's size was decreased by 15%. Not good for an actual compression algorithm, but for my little project, that's cool.
  -For the small sample file, the file's size was decreased by some incredibly low, negligible factor!
